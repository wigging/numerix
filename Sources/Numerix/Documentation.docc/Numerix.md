# ``Numerix``

Linear algebra and numerical computing with Swift on Apple devices.

## Overview

Numerix is an open-source Swift package that provides Vector, Matrix, and ShapedArray structures for performing linear algebra and other numerical computations on Apple devices. It uses the Accelerate framework for high-performance and energy-efficient calculations. See the Modules documentation for more information about the Vector, Matrix, and ShapedArray structures.
